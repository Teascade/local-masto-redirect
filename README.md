# Local Masto Redirect

Firefox AddOn that will attempt to detect whether you are on a remote
Misskey/Pleroma/Mastodon instance's post, and offer (via an injected button, and
a pageAction) to redirect you to your local instance's version of said post.

Configure your instance's base hostname from the ugly options menu available in
the Extensions-menu (accessed via Ctrl+Shift+A).

## Not battle tested
There will be a lot of bugs in how the extension works, it has not been battle tested yet.
